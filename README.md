### Set Configuration
The config_base.yaml file contains important settings for both training and testing.

Make sure to review and modify this file if youâ€™re using custom data or want to alter the network structure.

Please refer to the provided configuration file and update the data root in the data section.

### Training
1. Navigate to the UNET/trainer folder
2. Run one of the following commands:
```bash
python train.py
```
or
```bash
accelerate launch train.py
```

### Inference
1. Navigate to the UNET/tester folder
2. Modify the configuration path and safetensors path in test.py
3. Run the following command:
```bash
python test.py
```
